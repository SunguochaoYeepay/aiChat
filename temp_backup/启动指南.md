# AI Helper Startup Guide

## Simplified Startup Method

The project now only needs two startup scripts:

1. **start_admin.bat** - Start the Admin System
   - Access URL: http://localhost:8000/admin/
   - Features: Manage knowledge base, model configuration, service status, etc.
   - Startup time: Usually a few seconds

2. **start_api.bat** - Start the API Service (with Model Loading)
   - Access URL: http://localhost:8001/api/
   - Features: Provide AI conversation, image analysis, and other API interfaces
   - Startup time: First startup may take a few minutes (model loading time)
   - Special feature: Automatically loads large language model for conversations and image analysis

## How to Use

1. Double-click `start_admin.bat` to start the Admin System
2. Double-click `start_api.bat` to start the API Service (includes model loading)

> Note: Both services can run simultaneously, please start them in separate command windows.
> When starting the API service for the first time, model loading may take a few minutes. Please be patient and wait until you see the "Model test completed" message, which indicates that the model has been successfully loaded.

## Common Issues

1. **Unable to start the service?**
   - Make sure all dependencies are installed: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project root directory
   - Ensure the correct Python environment: Use Python 3.9+ version

2. **Model loading is slow or fails?**
   - Check if there is enough VRAM (8GB+ recommended)
   - Check if the model path is correct: Default path is `D:/AI-DEV/models/Qwen-VL-Chat-Int4`
   - Try modifying the model settings to CPU mode in the admin system (will be slower)

3. **Character encoding issues?**
   - The scripts now use UTF-8 encoding (chcp 65001) to correctly display Chinese characters
   - If you still see garbled text, make sure your command prompt supports UTF-8

4. **How to stop the service?**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the command window, then confirm to stop
   
5. **Port conflict issues?**
   - If ports 8000 or 8001 are occupied, you can modify the port numbers in the startup scripts

## Project Structure

- **admin_system/** - Django admin system and API implementation
- **scripts/** - Helper scripts
- **docs/** - Project documentation
- **chat_env/** - Python virtual environment

Other startup scripts are deprecated, please use the two scripts recommended in this document.

## Deprecated Scripts - Please Ignore

It is recommended to move all other startup scripts to a backup folder to avoid confusion. You can use the following command to do this:

```
mkdir temp_backup_scripts
move start*.bat temp_backup_scripts\
move launcher.bat temp_backup_scripts\
move fix*.bat temp_backup_scripts\
```

Then copy back our two main scripts:
```
copy temp_backup_scripts\start_admin.bat .
copy temp_backup_scripts\start_api.bat .
```
